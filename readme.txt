## Instructions
* Up to 4 players compete to get the highest score by collecting the grass and plums (I think they're plums?)
* You must avoid walkng into the brick wall on the edge of the screen.
* Whoever has the highest score at the end is the winner
* If you hit the outer brick wall, your score will be halved!


## Controls
* Keyboard: Either "W, A, D and Space", or "Q, O, P and Space"
* Should work with most controllers
* F11 - Toggle full screen
* Esc - quit


## Running on Linux
You will probably need to mark the program as an executable before Linux will allow you to run it.


## Running on a Mac
Since the app is not signed for a Mac (I don't even have a Mac), it shows "Application from unidentified developer" or even "Application is damaged and cannot Be opened" on first start. Try to open you game with Ctrl+Right Click and then Open. If it's not helping, open Terminal, enter "sudo xattr -cr /Path/To/MultiplayerSplat.app" and then open your game.
