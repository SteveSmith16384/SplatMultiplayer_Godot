## Running on a Mac
Since the app is not signed for a Mac (I don't even have a Mac), it shows "Application from unidentified developer" or even "Application is damaged and cannot Be opened" on first start. Try to open you game with Ctrl+Right Click and then Open. If it's not helping, open Terminal, enter "sudo xattr -cr /Path/To/MultiplayerSplat.app" and then open your game.
